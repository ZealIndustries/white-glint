<h1><a href="/"><img src="dclogo.png" alt="daisycha.in" height="58" /></a></h1>

<p>This is daisychain, our first public unveiling of a project we call
<b>social</b>. The idea behind <b>social</b> was to make it easy to
connect with all the people in your life, but without giving up
control of your relationships.</p>

<p>If you're using Facebook, and one day you decide to stop, or
another service comes along (Remember MySpace? Friendster? Orkut?)
&mdash; any and all contacts you have cannot be exported. <b>All your
friends go away, and you have to find people again</b>.</p>

<p>We think this is a bad idea.</p>

<p><b>Bad for you, and bad for society.</b></p>

<h2><img src="idea.png" alt="The idea:" /></h2>

<p>Start simple, start with status updates like Twitter and Facebook
already allow, and start getting people to begin updating their
profiles from something they <b>can</b> control:</p>

<p>Once you're comfortable and on-board with this, let's take your
ideas, suggestions and feedback, and build the social networking
software that we all want, and can all use.</p>

<h2><img src="offer.png" alt="What we offer:" /></h2>

<ul>

<li>Let's make that software available to everyone in the world, so
instead of having one big company in California with all of our
secrets, we can rely on friends and family, or even run our own
personal networks.</li>

<li>Let's build the escape rope in to all these networks, so people are
always able to pick up and leave whenever they feel like it, leaving a
forwarding address if they choose.</li>

<li>Let's make changing your social network a little more like moving
house and a little less like starting again without friends or
contacts in a foreign city.</li>

<h2><img src="youandus.png" alt="You and us:" /></h2>

<p>Who are we? We're a ragtail group of artists and geeks working to
bring this to you.</p>

<p>You don't have to trust us with your personal information, and in
fact, we'd rather you didn't.</p>

<p>We'd like you to join us and be a part of a revolution in the way
people share and socialize on the web.</p>

<p>Let's make the World Wide Web into the Social Web.</p>

<h2><img src="better.png" alt="Make it better:" /></h2>

<p>Anyone reading this, regardless of your ability to program
computers or make things look pretty can help make this software
better.</p>

<p>You can tell us what you like, what you hate, how things should be
different, and what features you'd like to see next.</p>

<p>We'll take the time to listen to you.</p>
