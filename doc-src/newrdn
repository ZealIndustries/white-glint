Welcome to the new and improved Rainbow Dash Network! We're pleased to bring you this upgrade to 
site functionality, which is the result of months of hard <!-- *snort* --> work. There are a variety of new features and 
changes across the site, and this document intends to cover the most important ones for old users 
returning to the site.

New, threaded timelines
-----------------------

Timelines have been given an overhaul in terms of organization. Now, instead of notices being shown 
in a strictly linear fashion, timelines are organized by conversation, with each conversation having 
its own spot on the timeline. This allows users to focus on the conversation they are having, 
without distractions from other topics getting in their way. The most recent responses are shown at 
the bottom of a conversation, to keep new information readily available for access.

For the users who prefer the old timelines, there is an option in the 
[Old-school settings](%%action.oldschoolsettings%%) page to revert back to linear timelines. Both 
options are fully supported across the site.

New ways to share notices
-------------------------

Sharing posts to groups is now easier than ever. Instead of having to remember the nicknames of 
every group you want to post to, they are all listed in a convenient dropdown list when you post a 
notice. Simply choose the group you want to post to. (The old method of posting to groups is still 
supported, in case you need to post to multiple groups.)

In addition, you can also share posts privately. This means nobody outside of the group will be able 
to see what you're posting. (If a private post is directed to "Everyone", it will only appear to 
users logged into the site.) This is a good way to share more sensitive information with a group, 
although anyone who joins later will still be able to find your notice.

Profiles and groups can both be set to private. This means all notices from that profile, or all 
notices to that group, will be forced to be private, and everyone who wishes to join that group, or 
subscribe to that user, must be approved.

More types of notices
---------------------

![The new status update form, with all of the different types of updates shown](/doc-src/img/newstatus.png)

In addition to improving notice sharing options, there are also more types of notices, targeted 
toward different uses. In addition to the standard status update, the new types of notices are:

**Bookmark:** A type of notice that centers around an external link. Great for sharing that news 
article you found, or any other links you have to share.

**Event:** A notice centered around something that's happening. Allows other members to RSVP as well 
as comment on the event itself. Great for organizing meetups.

**Poll:** A notice that asks a question. Other users can vote anonymously on up to five answer 
choices, with the votes being instantly aggregated and the top choices highlighted.

More ways to find notices
-------------------------

![An example of a user who has been added to some lists](/doc-src/img/usertagging.png)

There are now more ways to find the discussions that interest you the most. Tags and searches can now 
be subscribed to, bringing every notice with that tag (or every notice that shows up in that search 
result) to your Personal timeline.

In addition, it is now possible to create your own hand-picked lists of users, to follow all of your 
friends separately. Lists existed previously as profile tags, but now they've been expanded in 
numerous ways. Lists now get their own timelines, and can have descriptions set for them in case all 
of the information can't be relayed within the tag name. It is also possible to subscribe to another 
person's list, adding those users to your Personal timeline. For more information, refer to [the Tags page](/doc/tags).

Tags and searches you've subscribed to, as well as lists you've created, can all be found quickly under your Watched menu.

A new and improved mobile site
------------------------------

The mobile site has also received numerous improvements to usability and style, and should now be 
more convenient to use. The most important new feature is the ability to upload images from the 
mobile notice form.
