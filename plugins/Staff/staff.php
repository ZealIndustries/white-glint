It does not however, delete the picture content, that needs to be done by the administrator. When you delete a post with a illegal picture. Contact an Admin.</p>

<p><b>II)</b> For reference I would like all mods that do any silencing of users to email webmaster@rainbowdash.net people come to me with emails if they are silenced and I think it's best if we keep this under control so I know who has done what. CC: <a href="/user/2959">@Widget</a>, <a href="/user/3175">@CeruleanSpark</a>, <a href="/user/1199">@Colfax</a></p>

<p><b>III)</b> It is worth noting that every action you perform is logged by the database. Do not mess around with the administration and your powers. Widget will see it.</p>

<p><b>IV)</b> When you visit the profile of a user, you should see a box that says 'Moderate' You are given three options, Sandbox, silence, delete. Use sandbox for timeouts for small issues. Use silence when its time to shut up the user, and delete only if the account is 1. New 2. spammy 3. and posts illegal content. If it does not meet the first criteria. DO NOT DELETE. Silence instead. PM admin.</p>

<p><b>V)</b> Directives are sometimes issued by the administrator. You will get either a message on the site, or a direct message.</p>
